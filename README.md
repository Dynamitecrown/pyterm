# PyTerm

A tabbed SSH and serial terminal in Python — a PuTTY replacement you can
actually read the source of.

## Install

Python 3.10 or newer.

### Windows

Two ways to run it:

- **From source:** double-click **`run-windows.bat`**. First run builds the
  virtual environment and installs dependencies (~150 MB, mostly PySide6);
  every run after that just launches the app. Requires Python.
- **Standalone .exe:** double-click **`build-windows.bat`** once to produce
  `dist\pyterm.exe` (also needs Python, just for the build step). After
  that, `pyterm.exe` runs on its own — no Python required, safe to pin to
  the taskbar or copy to another machine. Re-run `build-windows.bat` after
  pulling changes to refresh it.

Manual way, in PowerShell from the project folder:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pyterm
```

If `Activate.ps1` is blocked by the execution policy, either unblock it for
that one shell:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

or skip PowerShell and use `cmd`, where `.venv\Scripts\activate.bat` has no
such restriction.

**Serial ports:** no permissions setup needed, but your USB console cable
needs a driver. Check Device Manager ▸ *Ports (COM & LPT)* — if the adapter
shows a yellow warning triangle, install the FTDI, Prolific, or Cisco driver
for it first. The Refresh button in the Serial tab lists whatever Windows
currently sees. COM10 and above work fine.

**SSH agent:** paramiko talks to Pageant, so keys you already have loaded in
PuTTY's agent work if you pick *SSH agent / default keys* as the auth method.

### Linux / macOS

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pyterm
```

On Linux you'll need to be in the `dialout` group to open serial ports
(`sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER`, then log out and back in).

## What works today

- **One window** — a new-session panel sits permanently on the left; no
  popup dialog to dismiss before you can see the terminal
- **SSH** — password, private key, or agent auth; host key verification
  against `~/.ssh/known_hosts` with a fingerprint prompt for unknown hosts
- **Serial** — port auto-detection, full 5–8 / N-E-O-M-S / 1-1.5-2 control,
  RTS/CTS and XON/XOFF, and **send break** (Cisco password recovery)
- **Tabs** — multiple sessions, movable, duplicate, reconnect in place
- **Saved sessions** — JSON profiles, PuTTY-style load/save/delete
- **Real VT100/ANSI emulation** — 16/256/truecolour, bold, underline,
  reverse, scroll regions, cursor addressing. `nano` and `htop` behave.
- **Scrollback** — mouse wheel or Shift+PgUp/PgDn
- **PuTTY mouse habits** — selecting copies, right-click pastes
- **Session logging** — raw byte log to a file per profile
- **Preferences** (`Ctrl+,`) — colour theme (six built-in presets or fully
  custom foreground/background/cursor/selection colours), default font and
  size for new sessions, and default scrollback. Sidebar can be hidden with
  `Ctrl+B`.

Passwords are deliberately never written to disk.

## Layout

```
pyterm/
├── profiles.py            saved sessions (JSON, no secrets)
├── settings.py            app-wide preferences (theme, default font)
├── emulation.py           pyte wrapper — the screen model
├── transport/
│   ├── __init__.py        Transport ABC + registry
│   ├── ssh.py             paramiko
│   └── serialport.py      pyserial
└── ui/
    ├── keys.py            Qt key event → xterm byte sequence
    ├── terminal.py        renders the screen, collects input
    ├── session.py         one tab: transport + reader thread + widget
    ├── dialogs.py         SSH/Serial/Advanced setting forms
    ├── sidebar.py         new-session panel + saved-session list
    ├── preferences.py     theme/font preferences dialog
    └── window.py          splitter, tabs, menus, status bar
```

Three layers, and they only touch each other through narrow interfaces:

1. **Transport** — anything that produces a byte stream. Doesn't know a
   terminal exists.
2. **Emulation** — bytes in, screen buffer out. Doesn't know Qt exists.
3. **UI** — draws the buffer, sends keystrokes. Doesn't parse escape codes.

### Threading

Each session runs a `ReaderThread` that blocks on `transport.read()` and
emits bytes via a Qt signal. Signals queue across threads, so pyte and the
widget are only ever touched from the GUI thread — pyte is not thread-safe.

Rendering is throttled to one repaint per 25 ms. Without that, a `show run`
dump triggers a full repaint per packet and the UI crawls.

## Adding things

**A new transport (telnet, raw TCP, local shell):** write one file in
`transport/`, subclass `Transport`, decorate with `@register("telnet",
"Telnet")`, and add it to `_load()`. Add the kind to the dialog's combo box.
Nothing else changes.

**Colour schemes:** the four theme colours (foreground/background/cursor/
selection) live in `settings.py`'s `THEMES` dict and are app-wide, set via
Preferences. The 16-colour ANSI palette used for SGR codes is still the
fixed `PALETTE` dict at the top of `ui/terminal.py` — move it into
`AppSettings` too if you want that themeable as well.

**Keyboard tweaks:** `ui/keys.py` is a lookup table. If you hit an old box
where Backspace misbehaves, flip `Qt.Key_Backspace` to `b"\x08"`.

**Saved passwords:** hook the `keyring` package into
`MainWindow._credentials_for()` — never into `profiles.py`.

## Known gaps (roughly in the order I'd fix them)

1. **Connect blocks the GUI thread.** Up to 12 s on an unreachable host.
   Move `transport.connect()` into a worker and marshal the host-key and
   password prompts back with a queued signal.
2. **No X11 or port forwarding.** paramiko supports both; it's plumbing.
3. **No search in scrollback.** pyte gives you the text, so this is a
   dialog plus a highlight pass in `paintEvent`.
4. **No mouse reporting** (modes 1000/1002/1006), so clicking in `vim`
   doesn't position the cursor.
5. **`HistoryScreen` scrollback is a little quirky** on resize — a known
   pyte rough edge, and the main reason a bigger project would eventually
   swap the emulator out.
6. **No SFTP browser, no scripting/expect.** Both are natural next tabs.

## Shipping it

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --name pyterm launcher.py
```

(`launcher.py` at the repo root, not `pyterm/__main__.py` — PyInstaller runs
the entry script as a bare top-level module with no parent package, which
breaks the package's relative imports if you point it at `__main__.py`
directly.)

On Windows that produces `dist\pyterm.exe`, which runs on machines with no
Python installed. Note that one-file PyInstaller builds are a common
antivirus false positive — if Defender quarantines it, drop `--onefile` and
ship the `dist\pyterm\` folder instead.

```
```

## Development

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
ruff check pyterm tests
```

The test suite covers the emulation layer (escape sequences, colour, resize,
scrollback, split UTF-8), key encoding, profile persistence, the transport
registry, and an end-to-end session over a real pty. The pty tests skip on
Windows. CI runs everything on Windows and Linux across Python 3.10 and 3.13.

Tagging a release as `vX.Y.Z` and pushing the tag builds a Windows .exe as a
workflow artifact.
